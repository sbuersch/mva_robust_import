# MVA App

Svelte project for MVA app, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run prepare
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command creates `build` folder which can be deployed. You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
